		=========================================

	
	The given program is intended for packing DOS executables(COM,EXE).
It uses original(?) modification of an LZ77 with 8192 byte sliding window
dictionary and lazy matching.

	Usage: LGLZ [-|/option] Input_mask [Output_File]

Options:
	[Output_file] - name of resulting file
	If not specified, input file is replaced

	-a - Always compress files with overlays
	-n - Never compress files with overlays
	-r - Delete overlays

	If the size, specified in EXE-file header does not coincide with
	true size on a disk, only the loading module is packed, and all
	other data (usually overlays, or other additional information)
	is stored after it without compression.

!!!!!!!!!!! Not all files with overlays will work in a compressed form!!!!!!!

	-o - Overwrite existing files

	By default you will be prompted, if the file already exists

	-b - Create backup copies of original files

	At packing with patterns (*.exe and etc.) the program
	will keep the originals under expansion .bak

	-h - Optimize EXE-header

	Allows to improve packing ratio by sorting of
	pairs segment/offset in relocation table
!!! At unpacking the initial table will not be restored 
(though usually it does not play any role)

	-0 - compression method 0 (default for files up to 38kB)
	-1 - compression method 1 (default for files larger than 38kB)

	The program uses two various methods of compression of received
	pairs length/offset, one of which is better for large files
	
	-sn - speed of compression (n from 0 to 9,
	     0 means fastest, 9 - tightest compression).
	     By default, LGLZ uses n=9.

	-x - Unpack a file

	-q - Don't show compression progress percentage

	-c - Information on files

	Displays the message on whether files, specified in a mask are
	compressed

	-f - Use the fast self-extracting module

	By default small self-extracting modules are used,
	that in case of large files a little bit slows down process
	of the compressed program's loading. Fast modules are 100-200
	byte larger than default (depending on a method)

	-u - Create a compressed file, which is unextractable
	     (by this program)

	-d - Change date/time to current system date 
 	     (by default date/time is not changed) 	

	-l - License agreement

Examples:

	lglz -hs0uf some.exe some.ex
	lglz -h -1 -s8 some.exe
	lglz -h1s8 some.exe
	lglz -xd some.exe

Brief history
--------------

	V0.1 (08-94)
		The first version of the program (LGLZC - COM-files packing)
	V0.2 (01-95)
		EXE-files packing (LGLZE)
	V0.3 (05-95)
		Optimization of EXE-header
	V0.4 (09-95)
		Added fast modules, creation of backup copies
	V0.5 (12-95)
		Added method 0 for large files
	V1.00 (05-03-96)
		First public release.
		The programs are incorporated in one,
		external program for header optimization LGOPTHDR is written
	V1.01 (12-03-96)
		Added option -u for unextractable files creation
	V1.02 (19-03-96)
		Slightly changed way of unextractable files creation,
		little bit accelerated packing
	V1.03 beta (30-05-96) 
		Unpacking and packing are 2 times faster than before
	V1.04A (04-12-97)
		Fixed serious bug in previous version which sometimes
		causes system crash while packing files, which ends
		with "xx 00 00"(xx - is non-zero byte)
	V1.04B (15-12-97)
		Fixed bug - sometimes program shows that file
		successfully packed and unpacking doesn't work
		(example - workshop.exe from BP package);
		same error causes incorrect output size calculation
		for some EXE with overlays.
		Added ability to specify path in input mask.
	V1.04C (11-03-99)
		Added -sn switch.
		Slightly increased speed of packing.
	V1.04D (17-03-99)
		Added -q switch.
		Increased speed by 3-10% (depends on CPU and method).
		Version for 8086 processor.
	V1.04E (28-10-99)
		Fixed bug - compression of R/O executables leeds to crash
